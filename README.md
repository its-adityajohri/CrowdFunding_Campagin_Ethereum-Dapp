# CrowdFunding_Campagin_Ethereum-DApp

In this project I have created a DApp for business projects CrowdFunding.
Basically it provides a platform to initail small bussiness and startups to crowdfund for there product making and inventory costs with the promise of delivering their product or service to the contributors in return.
People funding more than a minimum amount(set by crowdfunding requester) become contributors(Approvers).


In this project I have ensured transparency and security of the contributed money through smart contract.
Contract ensures that to use funded money for use, the manager of the project(product,bussiness) will genrate a request describing the money use and where its going, and it will only pass
if 50% approvers()approved contributors vote yes.

This ensures a Secure and transparent Crowdfunding, providing Contributors more ownership and control.
